            <p><h3><b><u>Summary</u></b></h3>This book had me on the edge of my seat the entireee time. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, going back and forth between the men in Lily’s life and constantly thinking – why doesn’t she leave if she isn’t happy? I won’t give away any spoilers but there is a heavy theme of domestic abuse throughout this book and helps show the internal debate that women have when they’re in a toxic relationship. It’s extremely easy to see someone in an abusive relationship and think “why doesn’t she leave already?” but it’s truly not that simple. Based on true events from the author’s life, this book outlines the terrifying cycle of domestic abuse and the effects it can have on women for generations to come. It Ends With Us is an eye-opening and suspenseful story that shows how all consuming and catastrophic domestic abuse can become. This book showed me the insider’s perspective to a terrifying situation and the rationale that women use to stay in unhealthy relationships – it is never as easy as it seems. There were many moments throughout this book that left me teary eyed and I wouldn’t be surprised if it did the same for you. It’s a binge read that somehow breaks your heart and then puts it back together.</p>

            <p><h3><b><u>Summary</u></b></h3>Verity” is a thrilling psychological suspense novel by Colleen Hoover. The story begins with Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer on the brink of eviction, witnessing a horrific accident on her way to a critical business meeting. 
During the incident, she encounters Jeremy Crawford, a man deeply affected by recent tragedies in his own life. Unbeknownst to both, they are headed to the same destination.At the end of the novel, Jeremy, Crew, and a pregnant Lowen are in the process of moving out of the Vermont house to start a new life in North Carolina. However, Lowen finds a letter addressed to Jeremy hidden under the floorboards in her room. In this letter, Verity makes shocking revelations. She reveals that she’d written the autobiography first as writing practice and then as a therapeutic exercise, casting herself as the “antagonistic narrator” as she did in her novels. The letter says that she had planned to escape with Crew and explains that Harper’s death was actually an accident. She says she still loves Jeremy and regrets what happened but must prioritize Crew’s safety. Lowen panics and destroys the manuscript, deciding never to burden Jeremy with the knowledge of it.  </p>

            <h2>"Atomic Habits" by James Clear</h2>

            <p><h3><b><u>Summary</u></b></h3>One of the best keynote speeches I’ve seen is Seth Godin’s presentation for his book Linchpin. On one of the slides, he shows a baseball bat flying into the stands, with people ducking away and raising their arms in terror.

                While Seth uses the picture to make a point about our irrational fears, in some rare cases, those fears come true. James Clear was one of those cases. When he was in high school, a loose bat smashed right into his face. Broken nose, dangerous brain swellings, dislocated eyes, fractures, his recovery took months.
